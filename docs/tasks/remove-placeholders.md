# Remove Placeholder and Template Content

This checklist will guide you through removing all default, placeholder, and template content from the Yika (忆卡) Chinese Flash Card App, such as the default "Create Next App" title and any other boilerplate text or assets left from the Next.js starter template.

```markdown
- [x] Search for and replace all instances of "Create Next App" with the correct app name (Yika or 忆卡) in code, metadata, and UI.
- [x] Update the `<title>` tag and any SEO/meta tags in `app/layout.tsx` or other relevant files to reflect the app's branding.
- [x] Remove or update any placeholder text, images, or links in `app/page.tsx` and other visible pages/components.
- [ ] Check for and remove any default Next.js, Vercel, or template-related comments, links, or assets in the codebase (including `public/`).
- [ ] Update the favicon and app icon in `public/` to match the Yika branding.
- [ ] Review and update README.md and documentation to remove any references to the Next.js template or boilerplate instructions.
- [ ] Test the app in the browser to ensure all placeholder/template content is gone and the app is fully branded as Yika (忆卡).
